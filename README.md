# McGill-CodeJam-2019

--- Introduction ---
This repository includes the source code for our work on a Real-time Gesture Detection model (RtGD). This work is developed with the help of my teammates (Kaiwen Xu, Tom Sarry, and Elsa Emilien) during the McGill CodeJam 2019 event (https://devpost.com/software/mr-bean) which wins the second place award in the Optional Theme - Internet of Things. I would also want to acknowledge Brenner Heintz (https://github.com/athena15/project_kojak) for the inspiration on this project and the pre-trained hand-gesture model.

This repository will be structured as follow:
1. Our goal for the project.
2. The function for each scripts.
3. The result of the RtGD model.
4. Future work and reflections.

Note, the code provided here is just the ML part of the CodeJam project. For the detailed description of the project and source code, please refer to the devpost page provided above. Some studies are conducted by using the ML code after the CodeJam ends, and the latest GtRD version is included in this repository.
